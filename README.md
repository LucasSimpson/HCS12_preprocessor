### 2DP4


##Why?
Let's face it, assembly blows. Is it cool manipulating the data at a hardware level? Of course. Do we really need to define every absract command? No.

##How?
Load your pre-assembly code into intput.txt, run assembly.py, and copy your output.txt file into CodeWarrior and witness the magic.

##Features
######All commands can be nested.

####loop (n) {}
anything enclised inside the curly brackets will be looped n times.
